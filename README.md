# learnBayes Starter Kit

This the the Starter Kit for the **learnBayes** workshop.

The kit contains data and code from the workshop presentation, so you can follow along and run the code while I explain it.

## Download the kit

To download the kit, please click on the green "Code" button above and then "Download ZIP". Unzip the folder after downloading it.

## How to use

All the text, code and data from the workshop presentations are available in this kit.

After downloading the kit, double click on the `learnBayesKit.Rproj` file to open the RStudio project.

To find the code, go to `slides/` and within `01_how_bayes` and `02_how_priors` you will find a file called `index.Rmd`. That is the file that generates the slides.

Simply open the file `index.Rmd` to follow along and run code.

The rendered slides can be opened by opening the `index.html` files in your browser.

## Package prerequisites

For the code to run smoothly, **please make sure you follow the [set-up instructions](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/learnBayes/setup.html).**

**If after opening the Starter Kit in RStudio you get asked to install extra packages or software, please do so.**
